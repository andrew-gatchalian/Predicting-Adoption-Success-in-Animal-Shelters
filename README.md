# Predicting Adoption Success in Animal-Shelters
üêæ Transforming Lives, One Algorithm at a Time! üê±

Discover how we utilized predictive analytics to generate actionable insights that can change how shelters find forever homes for cats! Developed by Andrew Gatchalian, Davidson Rajasekar, Devin Xiang Tian, Kaidi Huang, Yuanhui Yao at the University of California, Irvine.

- Implemented Python for extensive data cleaning and feature engineering, processing over 28,000 observations from the Austin Animal Center to create a streamlined dataset for modeling.
- Designed and evaluated multiple predictive models in R, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Ridge & LASSO Regression to predict cat adoption outcomes with up to 85% accuracy.
- Applied time series analysis using ARIMA and ETS models in R to forecast adoption trends.
- Incorporated Random Forest's feature importance metrics to highlight key predictors.

## Context
Our project aims to leverage historical data from an animal shelter to develop a predictive model
for animal outcomes. We will be utilizing data from the [Austin Animal Center Shelter Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewgatchalian/austin-animal-shelter-cleaned-dataset/data) dataset, as found on Kaggle. To assist with our analysis, we have cleaned the data for modeling
and interpretability purposes. We dropped several redundant variables and opted to keep only a
select few that we saw fit for our analysis. Additionally we feature engineered several variables
(such as converting days of the week to a weekend binary and converting outcome hours to a
categorical variable that describes the shelter‚Äôs morning, afternoon, and closed hours). We have
produced three CSV files for modeling and forecasting, and a separate file for EDA which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewgatchalian/austin-animal-shelter-cleaned-dataset/data) or through the data file on this Github.
